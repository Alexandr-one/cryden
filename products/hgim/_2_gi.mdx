### OVERVIEW

The GOS-155D/T Gyro-Stabilized, Two-Axial, Optical Gimbal sets new standards for the weight, size, and performance of professional thermal and RGB camera gimbals. It utilizes a built-in video processor to enable advanced image processing and several industry- standard communication interfaces while keeping the weight and power consumption low.

The built-in RGB camera offers up to 30x optical zoom and recording in HD which helps to capture and record vital details, maximizing the value of your operations. In addition to the RGB camera, the gimbal offers a high-performance thermal LWIR camera, built into the module offering a resolution of 1280х1024.

The optoelectronic onboard unit is designed to perform complex missions and is ideally suited for a wide range of applications, including prospecting, surveillance, rescue missions, maritime operations and object tracking, targeting.
