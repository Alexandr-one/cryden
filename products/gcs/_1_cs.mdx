### OVERVIEW

The pMDDLRadio Digital Data Link is a miniature, high power, long range broadband COFDM complete wireless solution. Based on the new Microhard pMDDL core, it provides the bandwidth and range needed for complex data intensive applications. The pMDDLRadio features 1W 2X2 MIMO 2.4GHz, using Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC), Maximal Likelihood (ML) decoding and Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) to achieve robust RF performance.

The miniature, lightweight and rugged design is a reliable communication partner for unmanned applications, both UAS and USV. The high speed, long range capabilities of the pMDDLRadio allow simultaneous high quality duplex transmission of full HD video and control \ telemetry data.

Typical range with skew planar wheel antennas is 9 km [6 mi], longer range (up to 200 km [124 mi]) is available using high gain antennas / RF amplifiers / automatic tracking masts.

Typical set for 8-9 km range includes:

- 2x on-board omni-directional 5 dBi antennas (30 g x 2 / 0.066 lb x 2)

- 2x ground panel LAN antennas 14 dBi (430 g x 2 / 0.95 lbs. x 2)

- Drone and ground modems in the same design

- Required companion connectors

- Antenna cables

- Required LAN / RS cables (details TBD with customer)
