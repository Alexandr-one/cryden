### OVERVIEW

The heavy-duty precision Pan Tilt Platform is a two - axis positioning system designed to withstand harsh and extreme environmental and weather conditions.

State-of-the-art built-in control electronics and algorithms provide precise, smooth motion at all speeds, while an integrated slip ring allows continuous rotation of the pan axis.

The body of the unit is made of high quality painted aluminum (or Saltwater Resistant Aluminum Alloy) with rugged hermetic circular military connectors.

### APPLICATION

- Payloads types: EO/IR, Antenna, Laser and similar systems

### SUPPORTED CONTROL INTERFACES & PROTOCOLS

- Ethernet (EtherCAT)
- CAN (CANopen, CANaerospace)
- RS422/485 (Modbus)
- Profile Position
- Profile Velocity

### FEATURES

- Hollow shaft for cables
- Electromagnetic brake for each of the axes
- Two-axes Gyro Stabilization (possible on request)
- GPS/GNSS True Heading (possible on request)
