### KEY BENEFITS

**Extended Service Life**: Reinforced stainless steel leading edges significantly increase wear resistance, delivering up to twice the operational life of standard blades.

**Superior Efficiency**: Optimized aerodynamic profiles improve lift-to-drag ratios, leading to higher fuel economy and increased payload capabilities.

**Cost-Effectiveness**: Streamlined production processes and durable construction reduce both initial procurement costs and lifecycle operating expenses.

**Reliability in Harsh Environments:** Carbon fiber prepreg construction with stainless-steel leading edges ensures resilience against sand, dust, rain, and saltwater conditions.

**Proven Safety:** Every rotor blade undergoes exhaustive internal fatigue and overload testing as well as real-world UAV flight trials, ensuring structural integrity and consistent performance.

**UAVOS Rotor Blades Successfully Pass Overload and Environmental Testing by ALTER Technology**

The test campaign involved simulated overload centrifugal loads exceeding the nominal operational limit of 7,390 N (753.32 kg) and a dynamometer measurement of 389 N (39.65 kg), and confirmed the following key characteristics of the rotor blades:

- structural integrity under extreme stress
- resistance to deformation
- reliability of materials and manufacturing quality

Environmental tests were conducted to verify the rotor blades’ reliability, durability, and safety under extreme climatic conditions ranging from -55 °C to +70 °C.

**Innovation in UAV Rotor Blade Manufacturing**

Unlike conventional glued-shell rotor blades, UAVOS uses one-step hot-molding technology with carbon fiber polymer composites. This advanced method eliminates glued joints, minimizes delamination risks, and provides superior structural strength. Multiple composite layers are applied with precise orientation and cured under controlled conditions, achieving the ideal balance of stiffness, durability, and aerodynamic efficiency.
