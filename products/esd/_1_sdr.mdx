### OVERVIEW

Xservo-Series lightweight, Hollow Shaft Servo Actuators features embedded CANopen / EtherCAT servo drive.

The advantage of this series is:
— the built-in motion controller, which allows the customer to skip the complex stage of mechanical and electrical integration of a passive servo actuator with an external servo drive controller
— a versatile hollow shaft that makes it easy to pass power supply cables, shafts or laser beams directly through the servo actuator.

New actuators are immune to shock and vibration and designed for use in harsh conditions.
