### OVERVIEW

UAVOS' family of parachute systems has been specially designed both for UAV recovery and as a safety measure that can be used in case of UAV catastrophic failure.

UAVOS parachutes benefit from an automatic cord-cutter system that releases the parachute once the air vehicle has landed, minimizing the potential for damage due to high wind.

Hand-sewn from high-grade parachute materials, the parachutes feature a variety of designs that offers the best compromise between packed volume and parachute drag coefficient, providing a safe and low-impact landing for your drones and payloads. The system has been thoroughly tested on UAVOS' drones.

### FEATURES

Key advantages of UAVOS’ Drone Parachute Systems are:

- High speed-range for initial phase of deployment: 20km/h to 220km/h tested, extension feasible
- Moderate G-load throughout total deployment-range due to configurable slider system: standard 
- Quick stabilization after deployment
- Low tendency of oscillation
- Extreme low weight and dimensions resulting in low effect on payload: standard 1.5-2.0kg with 4-6.5 liter volume
- Re-useable: 10+ deployments possible
- Development and production in accordance with aeronautical engineering regulations
- Verification of required parameters through special measuring equipment and video documentation during airdrop-tests
- Low adaptation and development efforts while in design phase to consider specific requirements.
