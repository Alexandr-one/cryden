## AP 10.1

Automatic Control System for UAV with a takeoff weight of 100 kg up to 4000 kg


### OVERVIEW

The Automatic Control System (AP) provides the hardware and vehicle control abstraction layer for the host platform enabling fully autonomous operation. All flight systems including take-off, landing, navigation and mission execution can be instigated with a single keystroke. All diagnostics, flight mission planning and remote control can be achieved wirelessly.

A notable feature of the AP is its distributed architecture. Each component of the system has a dedicated microcontroller providing data and communication with other components within the CAN bus. This decentralized configuration helps to manage central processor loading by distributing routine management tasks across all system components. Additionally, there are no restrictions on the number of same-type modules connected to one system, enabling multiple redundancy on all levels. With nearly all payloads or ready-made third-party modules, entire systems can be connected to the AP.

> FLEXIBILITY & SCALABILITY

Thanks to the AP’s distributed architecture, the system can be used in a wide variety of vehicles ranging from small quadcopter to full size converted piloted aircraft. The redundant layering provides basic functionality while ground control software is multi-platform and functions across multiple workstations in a both a wide or local area network configuration. Specific payloads/sensors can be integrated by scripting custom protocols through onboard Virtual Machines (VMs).

> COMPATIBILITY

The AP is compatible with almost any vehicle configuration (VTOLs, USVs, UGVs, etc.), including non-traditional aircraft concepts. The flight control algorithm relies on Total Energy Control System (TECS) for improved reliability and response to malfunction including automatic landing with engine failure, auto-rotation for helicopters and parachute deployment. The AP is resilient against jamming and features precise dead-reckoning navigation in absence of a GNSS signal.

Payload of almost any type can be connected and controlled using the interfaces:

-  1-Wire
- RS-232
- RS-485
- UART
- CAN
