ApusDuo is a solar-powered stratospheric High Altitude Pseudo Satellite (HAPS), developed by UAVOS. Its persistence enables a capability of flying continuously for months at a time, at around 20,000 m, above weather and conventional air traffic.

ApusDuo relies on solar energy, with the batteries charged in daylight to power overnight flight.

ApusDuo is aimed to provide a wide scope of applications in Connectivity, Earth observation, Weather, Security, Natural Resources and Emergency Disaster management.

The ApusDuo HAPS project became part of Mira Aerospace.
