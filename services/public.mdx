## PUBLIC USE

![](./assets/publicuse3.jpg)

Gain enhanced situational awareness during time-critical missions. Make informed decisions while reducing exposure to risk.

UAS can provide real-time visual information to aid in assessing disaster areas, high-risk situations, or search and rescue missions. The same applies to a public utility that needs fast, actionable data to get the lights back on after a major storm. Public use includes researchers, universities, environmental groups, and state- or federally-funded organizations. Authorized governmental functions can also include Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), aeronautical research, or biological or geological resource management agencies.
