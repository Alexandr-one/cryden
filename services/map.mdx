## SURVEYING AND GIS MAPPING

![](./assets/mapping.jpg)

UAVOS aircraft systems offer the ability to capture an entire renovation project in a single flight. Our post flight services process the imagery to stitch the imagery together to create an orthomosaic (a single image). Data received through a single flight can be used to manage future project development or shared with other surveyors and city planners.

UAVOS uses a number of different methods to gather information, including 3D measurement tools, sensing tools such as sniffer and infrared, and conventional aerial photography. Each of these traditional survey tools utilized alone are powerful analytic tools. UAVOS however can mix and match the payloads to create a more accurate and meaningful survey of the project with a resolution accuracy of 10cm.
