isrhas been two long years since we started a mutual business relationship. I cannot believe how far ISR Unmanned Technologies has come in this period. I was not expected to achieve and create so much so quickly.
A huge thanks to each of you for all the effort and dedication you have put into every project we have been involved in.
ISR and UAVOS share the same values and passion for what they do, respecting the environment with the aim to bring the best unmanned technology to the market.

	

I look forward to continuing growing together for the years to come.
