*By: [Imaging & Machine Vision Europe](https://www.imveurope.com/)*

With UAV manufacturers and flight system developers like UAVOS utilising computer vision to navigate GNSS-free environments, and NASA collecting huge data clouds to help them, are airborne transport systems about to take off?

With ground-level autonomous travel gaining trust, traction and most of the headlines, many developers of UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles) and even manned autonomous flight systems (autopilots) are looking at the open space above, to provide the future of transport and travel.

The majority of UAVs use GNSS (global navigation satellite system) alongside inertial sensors to track their speed, direction and positioning. In either locations where GNSS reception is weak – such as in remote or mountainous areas or near physical obstructions like trees or buildings – or situations where the signals are in danger of being jammed, the use of GNSS can’t be guaranteed.

**[High-altitude balloon-launched UAS measurements of atmospheric turbulence and comparison with infrasound response](https://amt.copernicus.org/articles/17/4863/2024/)**  
*By: [Atmospheric Measurement Techniques](https://www.atmospheric-measurement-techniques.net/)*

**UAVOS is a part of the study of using UAVs as a practical replacement for weather balloons.**

This study investigates the use of a balloon-launched uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) for the measurement of turbulence in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. The UAS was a glider which could conduct an automated descent following a designated flight trajectory and was equipped with in situ sensors for measuring thermodynamic and kinematic atmospheric properties. In addition, this aircraft was equipped with an infrasonic microphone to assess its suitability for the remote detection of clear-air turbulence. The capabilities of the UAS and sensing systems were tested during three flights conducted in New Mexico, USA, in 2021. It was found that the profiles of temperature, humidity, and horizontal winds measured during descent were in broad agreement with those made by radiosonde data published by the US National Weather Service, separated by up to 380 km spatially and by 3 to 5 h temporally. Winds measured during controlled flight descent were consistent with the winds measured by global-positioning-system-derived velocity during balloon ascent. During controlled descent with this particular payload, a nominal vertical resolution on the order of 1 m was achieved for temperature, relative humidity, and pressure with a nominal vertical resolution of the wind velocity vector on the order of 0.1 m; the aircraft had a glide slope angle from 1 to 4° during this time. Analysis approaches were developed that provided turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate, but it was found that the corresponding Richardson number was sensitive to the methodology used to determine the vertical gradients from a single flight. The low-frequency content of the infrasonic microphone signal was observed to qualitatively align with long-wavelength wind velocity fluctuations detected at high altitude. Moreover, the microphone measured more broadband frequency content when the aircraft approached turbulence produced by the boundary layer.

**Collaborative group studies the use of UAVs as a practical replacement for weather balloons.**

Over the years technology evolutions have played a meaningful role in helping scientists better understanding weather, providing the insights needed to make better predictions. Of course, gaining a better understanding often requires conducting multiple tests.

Case in point? UAVOS Inc. and Stratodynamics Inc. have successfully performed a series of stratospheric flights with the balloon launched HiDRON, an autonomous aircraft. The mission objectives were to advance new systems for forward sensing turbulence detection onboard aircraft at near-space and commercial flight altitudes. The early June campaign was supported by the NASA Flight Opportunities Program to advance turbulence detection sensors developed by the University of Kentucky (UKY) and NASA’s Langley Research Center.

Many years ago, as a young newspaperman, I received a plum assignment to retrace Charles Lindbergh’s trans-Atlantic flight. Rather than shivering in the Spirit of St. Louis monoplane, I flew the Atlantic in the Mach Two comfort of the Concorde. Eating lobster at a near-stratospheric 60,000 feet, I squinted at the curvature of the earth.
The quest to soar toward the sun dates back to mythology. But during 2020, an increasing number of lightweight unmanned vehicles have explored paths toward sustained solar-powered high altitude flight. Known as HAPS and/or HALE (see the “HAPS, HALE or Both?” sidebar on page 20), they soar between 55,000 and 70,000 feet above sea level, above clouds, wind and weather, with less power needed to maintain position. Station keeping above one point, or through footprint-expanding mini-fleets with reinforcing capabilities, they can cover more territory than ground stations and offer greater resolution, decreased latency and much lower costs against satellites. They can be landed and replaced during a single weather window.

**[UAVOS Successfully Tests Parachute System](/blog/UAVOS-July.pdf)**  
*By:  [Nation Shield](http://www.nationshield.ae/)*

UAVOS has successfully tested its new two-stage parachute system. The new parachute system design is aimed to provide slow descent of the unmanned air system (UAS) at high speed. It includes two parachutes – the pilot chute and the main chute used to slow and stabilise the UAS. The decrease in the load speed on the UAS occurs due to the main chute opening delay function, when the pilot chute opens first. The parachute system is designed for UAS with speeds of up to 280 mph (450 kph) and weight of up to 110 lb (50 kg).

The pilot chute allows safe slow descent of the UAV during the main parachute deployment, as well as to open up the main chute at a minimum altitude.
