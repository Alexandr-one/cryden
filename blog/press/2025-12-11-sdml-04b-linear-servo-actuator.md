**UAVOS is excited to introduce the newest addition to its servos line - the [SDLM-04B Linear Servo Actuator](/products/esd/_2_sdr/). The [SDLM-04B](/products/esd/_2_sdr/) is engineered for applications that demand high forces and long-term reliability. With its robust construction and powerful side-by-side motor and gearbox design, this actuator sets a new standard for performance and versatility, making it an excellent choice for multiple industries including unmanned aircraft.**

The [SDLM-04B servo actuator](/products/esd/_2_sdr/) features a brushless DC motor-controlled high-performance FOC servo drive and one contactless multiturn absolute position encoder. The device features feedback data such as the actual position, velocity, torque, bus voltage, and active motor current. The [SDLM-04B](/products/esd/_2_sdr/) features a power stage, BLDC motor, temperature and humidity control inside the case. The high-quality construction with hardened steel gears and aluminum housing is rated IP66.

The [SDLM-04B Servo](/products/esd/_2_sdr/) stands out due to its compact size, high force output, and servo control. Here are some of the key features that make this actuator a valuable addition to your project:

- Zero backlash: Increase mechanical reliability and accurate motion control authority.
- Integrated Controller: This simplifies setup and reduces wiring complexity.
- Compact Design: Despite its size of 314 mm (12"), it does not compromise on performance, delivering the power and reliability you need for your projects.
- High Force and High Speed: Capable of forces up to 1000 N or speeds up to 150 mm/s depending on the model.

The [SDLM-04B Linear Servo Actuator](/products/esd/_2_sdr/) is designed for a variety of applications. Its compact size and integrated control make it particularly useful in:

- Robotics: It is ideal for powerful, precise movements in compact designs. Plug and Play compatibility simplifies integration.
- Industrial Automation: It enhances the efficiency and reliability of automated systems.
- High-reliability UAV control: The SDLM-04B linear actuator is designed to excel in harsh shock/vibe environments with IP65 dynamic and IP67 static ingress protection ratings. 

UAVOS has successfully installed its SDLM-04B servo drives into the Albatross Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) aircraft flight control system and in the heavy-lift UVH 500 helicopters. The advanced actuators greatly extend the unmanned platforms’ reliability and safe steering while increasing operational flexibility.
