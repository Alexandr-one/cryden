The test campaign involved simulated overload centrifugal loads exceeding the nominal operational limit of 7,390 N (753.32 kg) and a dynamometer measurement of 389 N (39.65 kg), and confirmed the following key characteristics of the rotor blades:

- structural integrity under extreme stress

- resistance to deformation

- reliability of materials and manufacturing quality.
